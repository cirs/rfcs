Cirs RFCs
---

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow. Some
changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of
a design process and produce a consensus among the Cirs community. The "RFC"
(request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and
controlled path for new features to enter the language and standard libraries.
